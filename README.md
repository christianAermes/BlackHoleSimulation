# BlackHoleSimulation
 Render what a black hole would look like in front of an image.
 
 This project was originally inspired back when the image of the M87 black hole was published in April 2019. The idea for this project came from a coding challenge on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaz9TqYWUmA) from [The CodingTrain](https://thecodingtrain.com/).

## What does it do?
* The program uses raytracing to render the distortions on an image that is behind a black hole.
* The resolution of the rendered image can be adjusted to reduce the rendering time.

## How to run
The program was developed in Processing. Therefore, you will have to [install Processing](https://processing.org/download/) on your machine to run it.
